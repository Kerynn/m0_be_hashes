# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  * Something wasn't working when I tried checking my work in the terminal with the hashes_1.rb file. It kept showing different errors, and I would fix it, but then there would be a new error.
      * Ex. The header "Activity:" was trying to run as a code, so I changed it to be a Ruby comment, then there was a `p zoo` that was also trying to run, so I deleted that. It finally printed the array of `posts`, but nothing else would run.
  * I never could figure it out, and eventually checked my code by using `irb` in the terminal instead which all worked. Everything ran fine when I did the hashes_2.rb file.

  * **Update** I looked at my file one more time, and realized I did not have the `p` `print` before each command I was trying to run. yikes! It works now. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  * I have taken a lot of notes and they are getting really messy! I keep saying I will start a new notebook that will be dedicated to vocabulary terms broken up by the different lessons. I have some time planned for this weekend to do this. I think that will help me feel more organized, and be able to quickly reference my notes. Once I've established the different notebooks and color coding scheme, I think I will be better at taking cleaner notes moving forward. I take notes as I read through the lesson. Recently, I've started making notes when I have a question that will hopefully help me when forming technical questions.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  * I usually try really hard to problem solve the code on my own first- trial and error with typing in different scenarios using `irb` in the terminal. If I can't figure it out after a while, then I will do a google search. It probably takes up more time to try it on my own first, but I am seeing that when I am successful that way, I usually gain some sort of understanding that will help me moving forward. If I can find the answer online, I can follow the syntax to get the correct result, but then won't be able to problem solve the next time it comes up.
